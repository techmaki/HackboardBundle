Hackboard
=========

The goal of Hackboard is to help hackathon organizers run hackathons.

The areas that Hackboard covers are :

* pre hackathon
* during hackathon
* post hackathon

Hackboard is developed by Techmaki Sdn Bhd.

## Background

Hackboard was originally developed for attendees of hackathons to have a project page for the hackathon projects.  The goal was to help document all the projects that occur during a hackathon, so that other people can follow up with the project owners. It was developed so that project owners could update the details themselves.

But what we noticed is that during Hackathons, project owners do not have the time to maintain the project page. Hence it was decided that we pivot the application and help organizers themselves.
